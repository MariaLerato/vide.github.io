            <p>Before we start working on it, let's take a look at the steps to publish a webpage on GitHub.
                First, let's create the webpage we want to publish. This process is explained in the article How to Make a Website with HTML & CSS on your Computer. Check it out if you need help.
                *There will also be sample code, so you can continue with this article before completing your own webpage.
                Once you setup the webpage, upload the HTML and/or CSS files and images to GitHub. If you haven't made a GitHub account yet, you will need to make one first.
                Finally, by simply adjusting some file settings on GitHub, you'll be able to publish the webpage for free!
                It may sound difficult to publish your own webpage online, but don't worry, we'll show you a simple, step-by-step method.
                Let's get started!
